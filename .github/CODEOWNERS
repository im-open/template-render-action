  # Syntax notes:
  # - The syntax matches most of the same rules as gitignore files.
  # - https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#codeowners-syntax
  # - Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners (@user or @org/team-slug).
  # - Prefer team owners over individuals.
  # - Paths are case sensitive.
  # - Order is important.  The last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
  
  # These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo. Unless a later match takes
  # precedence, these teams will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
  # Draft PRs do not automatically request reviews until they are marked as Ready for Review.
  # If the repo's Branch Protection Rule requires code owner reviews, one of these team members
  # must sign off before a PR can be merged.
